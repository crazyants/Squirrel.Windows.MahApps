# Overview

This is a fork of [Squirrel.Windows](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows) that features a custom, Visual Studio style, installer UI.

It uses [MahApp.Metro](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro) for the styles and therefore has a dependency on it.

*Note that this fork is actually Shimmer, as it's version 0.7.4 of Squirrel.Windows/Shimmer and not the latest master.*
